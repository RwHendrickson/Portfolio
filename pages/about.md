<h1><b>About</b></h1>
I am a member of the <a href="https://www2.minneapolismn.gov/government/departments/health/sustainability-homes-environment/sustainability/green-zones/">South Side Green Zone Council</a>, a volunteer with the East Phillips Health Team, and recently completed a term as a visiting instructor at Macalester College (Fall 2024).

Research interests include: historic and contemporary barriers to racial equity; spatio-temporal modeling; and consequences of climate change. I am also passionate about community education and procedural justice in decision making.
<br><br>
In my free time I enjoy paddling, dancing, making music, and writing.

<h1><b>Bio</b></h1>
I was raised on [Dakota Land](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/oceti-sakowin-sioux/) in the town of Red Wing, Minnesota where I was taught a deep appreciation of our natural world at the [Red Wing Environmental Learning Center](https://redwingelc.com/about). In 2017, I graduated from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities with a B.S. in mathematics and moved to Australia.

After 15 months of work-traveling as a farm hand, arborist's assistant, and general labourer, I returned to the States to serve 2 terms as an Americorps math tutor in Minneapolis. During this time I was introduced to the [Mapping Prejudice](https://mappingprejudice.umn.edu/) project, experienced the [George Floyd Uprising](https://unicornriot.ninja/?s=george+floyd+minneapolis), and began volunteer-organizing with various grassroots movements. 

These experiences led me to the University of Minnesota's <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/mgis/about/program-thats-map">Masters of Geographic Information Science (MGIS)</a> program, which I graduated from in the Spring of 2023.

Throughout and immediately after my degree, I focused on applying new skills to study air quality and cumulative impacts to assist EJ movements in Minneapolis including the [Roof Depot Struggle](https://www.epnifarm.org/about), the [Shut Smith Coalition](https://sahanjournal.com/climate-environment/mpca-epa-smith-foundry-minneapolis-scrambled-response/), and "[SpikeAlerts](https://spikealerts.github.io/Website/)" - a loose collective working toward a free and open-sourced alert system for community air monitoring projects.

<!--## **Ancestry & Land Acknowledgment**

On my mother's side, I am descended from Eastern European, Scandinavian, and English immigrants of the modern Chicago-area which is stolen [Patowatomi](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1001.html) land. The history of these immigrant populations is [complex](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1033.html) but can partly be summarised by themes of intimate ethnic identities, lively cultural exchanges, and racial exclusion & violence (particularly against African Americans of the Great Migration). 

My father's ancestors are Norwegian and [Frisian](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/WiMH/31/Founding_of_New_Amsterdam_in_Lacrosse_County*.html) farmers who settled in the Driftless Area near modern-day La Crosse, Wisconsin in the mid to late 1800's. These fertile lands were considered sacred by the Ho-Chunk, Sauks, and Meskwakis but were appropriated through infectious disease epidemics and increased pressure from European and US settlement. The forced Treaty of St. Louis (1804) and resulting [Black Hawk War of 1832](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War#Treaties_and_removals) marked an increase in US government policies that forcibly displaced Native Americans in this area. 

By 1871 the US government had "changed its focus to "de-Indianizing" this population, creating schools that attempted to rid them of their cultural traditions and ways of life by breaking tribal ties and molding them into the image of white settlers" which included a [boarding school](https://honoringnativeancestors.blogspot.com/2017/09/tomah-school.html) in nearby Tomah ([Source](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/minority-health/population/amind-pophistory.htm)).-->
