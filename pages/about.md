## Bio

I was raised on Mdewakanton and Wahpekute land in the town of Red Wing, Minnesota where I was taught a deep appreciation of our natural world. In 2017, I graduated from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities with a B.S. in mathematics and have worked in various fields since.

My research interests include: historic and contemporary barriers to racial equity; urban environmental justice; spatio-temporal modeling; and consequences of climate change. I am also passionate about community education and procedural justice in decision making.

In my free time I enjoy paddling, dancing, making music, and writing.
