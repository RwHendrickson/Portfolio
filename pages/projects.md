# Modeling Cercarial Dermatitis

In the summer of 2016, I participated in an undergraduate research experience at the University of Wisconsin – La Crosse. Following their crash course in mathematical ecology, my mentors, [Dr. Greg Sandland](https://www.uwlax.edu/profile/gsandland/) and [Dr. James Peirce](https://www.uwlax.edu/profile/jpeirce/), paired me with another undergraduate student, [Kelly Buch](http://feffermanlab.org/kelly.html). Tasked with finding our own research topic, my partner and I scoured countless articles and research papers. We eventually resolved to study cercarial dermatitis, also known as swimmers’ itch, because the control practices at that time were particularly harmful to lake ecosystems. By the end of the summer, we had built our own mathematical model of the parasite-host dynamics and coded a specialized RK4 differential equation solver into Matlab. This allowed us to experiment with more ecologically sound treatment methods and devise recommendations for lake management across the Midwest.

We later presented our project at the 2017 Joint Mathematics Meeting in Atlanta, and our preliminary work led to a [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342077609_A_mathematical_model_for_the_control_of_swimmer%27s_itch) in 2020 by Dr. Peirce and Dr. Sandland, in which we are acknowledged.
